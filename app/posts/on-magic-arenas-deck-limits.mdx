# some perspective
[wizards of the coast](https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/magic-the-gathering-becomes-hasbros-first-1-billion-brand/) a **billion** (with a b) dollar company creates a
pretty interesting game involving cardboard and magic. a game which i have enjoyed despite the insane f2p economy.

a billion dollars is beyond an absurb amount of money. a billion of anything is not something human beings can remotely visualize. if you wanted to try though you could check out
[printing money](https://neal.fun/printing-money/) or attempt to [spend 1 billion of bill gates insane 100 billion fortune](https://neal.fun/spend/) created the utterly amazing [Neal Agarwal.](https://twitter.com/nealagarwal)

<Aside mood='rat'>
    *hint*:<br/>try 250 million big macs currently priced at 3.99 USD...
</Aside>

# just how many people play this game?
looking through a few sources we can gather *(ha)* that there is something like [7 million average users a month](https://activeplayer.io/magic-the-gathering-arena/).

thinking about that for a second, 7 million users is just how many people that play the game a month. we can realistically safely assume
there is like 20 - 40 million accounts. 

(source: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)

# napkin maths
in the same way that you don't design a bridge to hold  *'like about that much...'* you generally want to overestimate by quite a bit.

depending on the needs of the application, the context, the phases of the moon, you want to give different kinds of margins.

for example, a machine that burns cookies 1% of the time is perhaps a little less severe than a machine that explodes kittens at the same rate.

so a healthy overestimate of 7 million monthly users to a total of 80 million users is probably a safe margin for the scale currently being operated at when we take in yearly growth.

# just how big is that?
i caught a <s>fish</s> 80 million users about thiiiiiiiiiiiiis big.

the max profile picture size for twitter is 2mb. so if we added the ability for all users to have a custom image, just how much data is that?

oh i don't know...

**160 terabytes**

[aws tells us](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) that a gb is worth about 0.021 USD or about 2 cents and 2 [<s>british</s> american ha'penny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_penny)


`160tb is 160gb * 1000gb (1000gb is 21 USD.)` 
`21 USD per 1000gb for 160tb = 160 * 21 USD is => 3360 USD per month or 40,320 USD a year`

so for nearly double the median salary of a [single mom in ohio](https://statusofwomendata.org/explore-the-data/poverty-opportunity/additional-state-data/median-household-income-by-household-type/) our
users can have profile pictures.

and that is just 2 megabytes, 2 * 10^6 (2,000,000) bytes.

<LineChart data = {
    {
        labels: [...Array(12).keys()].map((val) => 'year ' + (val + 1)),
        datasets: [
            {
                label: 'total cost year-to-year for 160tb in USD',
                data: [...Array(12).keys()].map((val) => (val + 1) * 21 * 160 * 12),
                borderColor: 'rgb(232, 165, 114)',
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(232, 165, 114)',
            }
        ]
    }
}/>

we now have the needed context we can get to work. in other words we can finally get to:

<highlight id="billion">
# how to handle 8 billion text files
</highlight>
to what do we owe a text file? and to what does a text file owe to us?
well to start they're usually very small. like teeny tiny.

here is my friend [Xe\'s](https://xeiaso.net/) seemingly [favorite letter](https://github.com/Xe/hlang), h.
`$ echo h > h.txt`
`ls -l`
`... 2 h.txt `

2 bytes (on my text encoding)! wow that is small.

<Aside mood='default'>
    the amount of space any given character takes up depends on the encoding scheme present.
    [utf-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) for example encodes bytes variably from 1-4 bytes per
    character. 

    this is why the ascii alphabet can be represented with one byte (8 bits) but more complex characters requires multiple bytes.

now a magic the gathering deck file looks like this when exported from some tool like mtggoldfish

this file is only 500 times the size of the h file at a whopping...
1006 bytes.

this is a pretty good case file actually, most of the cards are 4 ofs (the max in a deck).
you could have something much worse as there are multiple formats that MTGA supports.

take for example this 100 card singleton deck.

now this file is 2446 bytes! although this is probably the average worst case.

it *could* be worse with custom arts for each deck file. plus building a singleton deck around cards with long names
such as the oh so fun to say asmoranomardicadaistinaculdicar! (as-more-an-uh-mar-dih-cuh-dye-stin-uh-cuhl-dih-car).

<asmor>
![the card itself](https://cards.scryfall.io/png/front/d/9/d99a9a7d-d9ca-4c11-80ab-e39d5943a315.png?1632831210)
</asmor>
see [this pronounciation guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYbXBIUCtHM)

the deck limit is currently ~100, and there is 7 million users, but we're overestimating and assuming something like 80 million, with the worst case scenario being 2500 bytes (2.5kb)
doing some math we can see that takes up...

`100 * 2.5kb = 250kb (.25mb)`
`(.25mb) * 80 million = 20 million megabytes (20,000,000mb or 20,000gb or 20tb)`

using our handy dandy graph from earlier we do some computations and...

<LineChart data = {
    {
        labels: [...Array(12).keys()].map((val) => 'year ' + (val + 1)),
        datasets: [
            {
                label: 'total cost year-to-year for deck storage (@ 20tb~) in USD',
                data: [...Array(12).keys()].map((val) => (val + 1) * 21 * 20 * 12),
                borderColor: 'rgb(232, 165, 114)',
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(232, 165, 114)',
            }
        ]
    }
}/>

over some 12 year period that only costs us 60,000 USD.

that's not too bad but i think we can do **much** better.

firstly we need to understand this problem is a little more complex than just deck files.

magic arena being the f2p economy is incentivizes players to spend money by having alternative arts for each card.
there are a few ways to handle this.

# an approach
what if we just compressed the text through an encoding scheme?

turning a card such as
`1 Swords to Plowshares <retro> [BRC]`
to
`brc-stp r `

we partially encode some data into the file format where a lack of a number is simply just 1.

acknowledging same set name collisions we could embed an index, or pregenerate a look up table, or just keep
adding letters until it is unique. an example of this happening would be in 10E 
where both Peek and Persuasion are cards in the set.

example solution output
`1 Peek [10E]`
`1 Persuasion [10E]`
to
`10E-p0 or 10E-p`
`10E-p1 or 10E-pe`

both have benefits and drawbacks but variadic numeric indexing is likely the most efficient approach
with this encoding scheme to solve collisions.

this adds often only 2 byte overheads to each collision so it is negligible in my protoyping, 
(to be read as: i'm not implementing this for now but acknowledging it)

just how much does this encoding reduce our sizes?

in the best worst case scenario we can reduce it substantially. but what about something more average?

even in this more realistic example we get still get a substantial reduction of nearly 4 - 5 times.

applying this to our data model:

`100 * 862b = 86.2kb (.086mb)`
`(.086mb) * 80 million = 6.88 million megabytes (6,880,000mb or 6,880gb or 6.88tb)`

<LineChart data = {
    {
        labels: [...Array(12).keys()].map((val) => 'year ' + (val + 1)),
        datasets: [
            
            {
                label: 'total cost year-to-year for deck storage (@ 6tb~) [reduced w/ method 1] in USD',
                data: [...Array(12).keys()].map((val) => (val + 1) * 21 * 6.88 * 12),
                //
                borderColor: '#9dfa98',
                backgroundColor: '#9dfa98',
            },

            {
                label: 'total cost year-to-year for deck storage (@ 20tb~) [non-reduced] in USD',
                data: [...Array(12).keys()].map((val) => (val + 1) * 21 * 20 * 12),
                borderColor: 'rgb(245, 93, 93)',
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(245, 93, 93)',
                borderColor: '#fa989b',
                backgroundColor: '#fa989b',
            },
        ]
    }
}/>

some validation will need to be done and maintenance on the compendium of card names which adds to cost but that is not within the scope of this solution.

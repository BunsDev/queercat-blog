# some perspective
[wizards of the coast](https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/magic-the-gathering-becomes-hasbros-first-1-billion-brand/) a **billion** (with a b) dollar brand creates a
pretty interesting game involving cards and magic. a game of which i have enjoyed despite the insane f2p economy.

a billion dollars is beyond an absurb amount of money. a billion of anything is not something human beings can remotely visualize. if you wanted to try you could check out
[printing money](https://neal.fun/printing-money/) or attempt to [spend 1 billion of bill gates insane 100 billion dollars](https://neal.fun/spend/)

how about we try visualizing something easier.

# just how many people play this game?
looking through a few sources we can gather that there is something like [7 million average users a month](https://activeplayer.io/magic-the-gathering-arena/).

# me + web assembly = ðŸ’–
oh how i love WASM. it's not even funny (maybe a little, considering my hate for java).
granted the JVM is perhaps just a little different, but bytecode this bytecode that.

i want to make you agree with me through my powers of unadulterated rhetoric. and perhaps a little fun.

the world's simplest web assembly binary can be expressed as such:

<code>
```
# you can copy and paste this! #
0x00 0x61 0x73 0x6d # magic 0 A S M #
0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 # version 1 0 0 0 #
```
</code>

how would you like to write some raw bytecode? "yes!" i hear you cry.
